I tried to generate some data relevant to users in this folder. 

The following files are downloaded from https://eightportions.com/datasets/Recipes/:
  - recipes_raw_nosource_ar.json
  - recipes_raw_nosource_epi.json (what I actually used in generating the carts, ownership and etc..)
  - recipes_raw_nosource_fn.json
  
The data I generated:
  - users.txt: each line is usrID+usrName+Address
  - ownership.txt: each line is usrID+recipeID
  - favorites.txt: each line is usrID+recipeID
  - cart.txt: each line is usrID+recipeID+dateUpdated

To understand how I generated the above files, please refer to generating_more_data.py.

What remains to do:
1. I tried but could not crawl images from the above website. It directs me to https://github.com/rtlee9/recipe-box, which is not helpful in crawling either, since the page arragement of the website seems to have changed over the years, and I am not familiar with BeautifulSoup package. Alternatively, maybe we can manually add correct pictures for 10 recipes and set the rest to be the same picture?

2. Generate some user profile pictures
